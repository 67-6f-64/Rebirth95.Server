Need before Greed: Party members who are unable to equip the item being rolled are not given the option to "need" roll on it, meaning those that can equip the item have automatic preference on it if they want it. Not as fair as it seems at first glance. Just because you can equip an item does not mean you need it.

Free-for-all: (FFA) First-come, first-serve. You snooze, you lose. This is a good setting if you are assisting someone and intend for them to be able to loot all the kills, or if your party is not in the same area, this setting will prevent meaningless roll prompts. It also makes sense when grouping somewhere that isn't a dungeon, when it's very unlikely a really valuable item will drop.

Game feedback from discord:

a solid server thats not [Old School Maple] shit 1x1x1x
and has atleast 300+ people
or enough people to find maple babes and troll

I don't actually play ms but I'd assume unscripted quests/npcs.
Like if you're playing, trying to get certain quests completed, and you find an unscripted npc and can't complete a quest, it's immersion breaking.
Just my opinion

people like fast paced gameplay
faster spawn rate, higher mob density, lots of drops (can be slow progression, but more drops), nx from mobs
as well as easy methods to upgrade gear and far endgame
keys to server success
[redacted]'s servers had all of this and fwif they all had 1000+ online users and racked in the most money, for a reason
issue with his game design is that theres not much to do after endgame so peopole quit
and market gets inflated too quickly
meso/nx sink
whatever the inflated currency is, just needs a sink
and make sure the higher end players cannot farm ridiculous amounts compared to midgame
for [redacted]'s servers he could've made cubing require meso rather than making it so reaching level 100 on insight trait makes cubing only require cubes
for my server i have a nice meso sink to add a week after official launch
one of the sinks i have is the 4th job skip scroll costing 75m rather than 10m

Own ideas:
Exclusive server, invite-only <- this would only work with a server that actually has something to offer that is unique
Staff members have unlimited invites

Advanced Fishing Economy System:
there are many spots to fish
there are afk-safe and afk un-safe spots to fish
afk un-safe spots will once in a while spawn a demi-boss (or maybe pianus?)
fish are sold to an npc for coins
the coin value of a fish depends on the amount of a particular fish that has been sold to the npc over a given period
coins can be used to purchase rare items from another npc
